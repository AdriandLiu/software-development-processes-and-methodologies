# Assessing Quality Through Scenarios Assignment

The learner will select a preferred website. Considering the website, the learner will identify three quality attributes that would be important to the site's success and write one reasonable scenario for each quality attribute, presented in one of the formats presented in class.  


For each quality attribute and corresponding scenario, the learner will be graded on the following aspects:

* Properly and clearly identifying the quality attribute
* Explanation of importance is present, clear, reasonable, and well-written \(clear language, proper grammer, correct spelling\)
* Scenario provided captures the related attribute
* Scenario follows a provided format
* Scenario is present, clear, reasonable, and well-written \(clear language, proper grammar, correct spelling\)

Select a public website that you use enough to be familiar with what a typical user may want to do. This website should not require the peer reviewer to sign up for an account or pay to use the site in any way. The website should also not, to the best of your knowledge, serve malware, use JavaScript to complete cryptocurrency mining, or any other negative practice that might harm the peer reviewer.

Select three quality attributes that are likely to be important when deciding a website architecture for the website you chose. You can use usability, security, performance, reliability, or any other reasonable quality attribute as the basis of your selection. Briefly explain the importance of each quality attribute as it relates to the software/service you selected.

Then, for each selected quality attribute, write one scenario that would help quantitatively assess whether the software solution meets its goal. You shall write your scenarios using a format that was presented in the lectures.
