# Agile Software Development - Story Mapping Assignment

**Assignment:**

In this assignment, you will create a story map based on the high-level vision for the Remote Deposit Capture system \(the case study from earlier\). You will only focus on one part of this system: the mobile app.

The high-level requirements are specified in the attached, fictional case study description. Please read the case study below before you proceed further.

Since the system description only outlines the product vision, you may need to make some reasonable assumptions about the user's needs and the related functionality necessary to satisfy them. Similarly, feel free to make assumptions about some of the finer product details as well.

Case​ ​Study:​ ​Remote​ ​Deposit​ ​Capture

1. Recently,​ ​several​ ​banks​ ​have​ ​started​ ​offering​ ​customers​ ​remote​ ​deposit​ ​capture.​ ​With this​ ​new​ ​service,​ ​customers​ ​do​ ​not​ ​have​ ​to​ ​physically​ ​go​ ​to​ ​banks​ ​or​ ​ATM​ ​machines​ ​to deposit​ ​checks​ ​anymore.​ ​Instead,​ ​they​ ​can​ ​send​ ​checks​ ​as​ ​a​ ​scanned​ ​image​ ​through​ ​an Internet​ ​portal​ ​provided​ ​by​ ​the​ ​bank.
2. This​ ​technology​ ​can​ ​save​ ​banks​ ​and​ ​customers​ ​time​ ​and​ ​money​ ​making​ ​the transactions.​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​is​ ​considering​ ​implementing​ ​this​ ​new​ ​service.
3. To​ ​use​ ​it,​ ​customers​ ​need​ ​a​ ​remote​ ​capture​ ​account​ ​with​ ​Blue​ ​Bank.​ ​In​ ​addition,​ ​they can​ ​either​ ​download​ ​an​ ​app​ ​on​ ​their​ ​phone​ ​or​ ​they​ ​need​ ​to​ ​install​ ​a​ ​browser​ ​plugin​ ​to use​ ​any​ ​general​ ​purpose​ ​scanner​ ​attached​ ​to​ ​their​ ​computer.​ ​The​ ​customer​ ​will​ ​be prompted​ ​to​ ​install​ ​the​ ​browser​ ​plugin​ ​when​ ​customer​ ​tries​ ​to​ ​deposit​ ​checks​ ​using bank’s​ ​internet​ ​portal.
4. Once​ ​the​ ​account​ ​is​ ​established​ ​in​ ​the​ ​system​ ​and​ ​customer​ ​has​ ​setup​ ​the​ ​mobile​ ​phone or​ ​browser​ ​plugin,​ ​customers​ ​will​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​scan​ ​all​ ​of​ ​their​ ​checks​ ​anytime​ ​and anywhere​ ​by​ ​using​ ​the​ ​bank​ ​mobile​ ​app​ ​or​ ​by​ ​accessing​ ​the​ ​bank’s​ ​Internet​ ​portal, logging​ ​in,​ ​and​ ​scanning​ ​the​ ​checks.
5. The​ ​service​ ​should​ ​be​ ​as​ ​easy​ ​as​ ​sending​ ​an​ ​attachment​ ​in​ ​an​ ​email.​ ​Of​ ​course,​ ​this new​ ​application​ ​has​ ​to​ ​be​ ​very​ ​reliable,​ ​secure,​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​to​ ​use.​ ​It​ ​must​ ​be​ ​integrated into​ ​the​ ​current​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​Web​ ​site,​ ​and​ ​the​ ​Web​ ​site​ ​must​ ​also​ ​provide​ ​the​ ​ability​ ​for customers​ ​to​ ​purchase​ ​the​ ​general​ ​purpose​ ​pre-tested​ ​scanners.
6. Blue​ ​Bank​ ​will​ ​set​ ​up​ ​the​ ​scanner-purchasing​ ​ability​ ​with​ ​several​ ​appropriate​ ​hardware vendors​ ​and​ ​sell​ ​the​ ​devices​ ​at​ ​its​ ​physical​ ​banks​ ​as​ ​well.
7. Blue​ ​Bank​ ​is​ ​not​ ​sure​ ​yet​ ​what​ ​to​ ​charge​ ​for​ ​the​ ​scanners​ ​or​ ​service.​ ​The​ ​Website​ ​will also​ ​provide​ ​online​ ​technical​ ​support​ ​and​ ​instructions​ ​showing​ ​customers​ ​how​ ​to​ ​setup and​ ​use​ ​the​ ​new​ ​scanner​ ​and​ ​service.​ ​Support​ ​will​ ​be​ ​provided​ ​24/7​ ​via​ ​the​ ​Web​ ​site and​ ​telephone.
8. Several​ ​managers​ ​at​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​are​ ​not​ ​sure​ ​that​ ​they​ ​should​ ​invest​ ​in​ ​remote​ ​deposit capture.​ ​The​ ​bank​ ​prides​ ​itself​ ​on​ ​being​ ​customer-oriented,​ ​having​ ​several​ ​large​ ​bank buildings,​ ​ATMs​ ​and​ ​remote​ ​bank​ ​sites​ ​in​ ​many​ ​grocery​ ​stores,​ ​primarily​ ​throughout​ ​the Midwest.​ ​Many​ ​of​ ​its​ ​customers​ ​have​ ​banked​ ​with​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​their​ ​whole​ ​lives,​ ​but​ ​less than​ ​half​ ​of​ ​them​ ​use​ ​any​ ​of​ ​its​ ​current​ ​Internet​ ​banking​ ​services.
9. The​ ​new​ ​VP​ ​of​ ​IT​ ​was​ ​hired​ ​to​ ​prepare​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​for​ ​the​ ​future​ ​and​ ​to​ ​reduce​ ​the​ ​loss​ ​of younger​ ​customers​ ​who​ ​have​ ​moved​ ​to​ ​banks​ ​that​ ​are​ ​more​ ​progressive.

10. **Initial**​ ​**estimates**​​ ​suggests​ ​that​ ​the​ ​project​ ​will​ ​take​ ​6​ ​months​ ​to​ ​complete​ ​and​ ​cost​ ​about $500,000.​ ​Annual​ ​operating​ ​costs​ ​would​ ​be​ ​about​ ​$150,000​ ​per​ ​year​ ​for​ ​three​ ​years. Estimated​ ​benefits​ ​are​ ​about​ ​$400,000​ ​per​ ​year​ ​for​ ​three​ ​years.

11. Harold​ ​Johnson,​ ​the​ ​project​ ​sponsor,​ ​had​ ​told​ ​you​ ​that​ ​​**you**​ ​**will**​ ​**be**​ ​**leading**​ ​**this**​ ​**project** and​ ​​​it​ ​is​ ​important​ ​to​ ​finish​ ​on​ ​time​ ​and​ ​within​ ​budget,​ ​but​ ​it​ ​is​ ​even​ ​more​ ​important​ ​to provide​ ​a​ ​high-quality​ ​service​ ​and​ ​avoid​ ​any​ ​potential​ ​technical​ ​or​ ​user​ ​problems​ ​after implementation.​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​wants​ ​to​ ​attract​ ​new​ ​customers​ ​with​ ​remote​ ​deposit​ ​capture and​ ​avoid​ ​losing​ ​current​ ​customers,​ ​so​ ​quality​ ​and​ ​customer​ ​service​ ​is​ ​key.

12. **The**​ ​**team**​​ ​to​ ​work​ ​on​ ​this​ ​project​ ​has​ ​4​ ​developers,​ ​2​ ​testers.​ ​Most​ ​of​ ​the​ ​developers​ ​and testers​ ​has​ ​offices​ ​on​ ​different​ ​floors​ ​of​ ​the​ ​building​ ​and​ ​generally​ ​works​ ​in​ ​their​ ​office.

13. The​​ ​**team**​ ​**members**​​ ​have​ ​some​ ​​**experience**​ i​​ n​ ​web​ ​development​ ​but​ ​none​ ​in​ ​mobile development.​ ​Nobody​ ​on​ ​team​ ​has​ ​performance​ ​testing​ ​experience​ ​or​ ​User​ ​experience expertise.​ ​Also,​ ​since​ ​this​ ​is​ ​the​ ​first​ ​agile​ ​project​ ​for​ ​the​ ​team,​ ​they​ ​are​ ​not​ ​familiar​ ​with engineering​ ​practices​ ​like​ ​automated​ ​testing,​ ​continuous​ ​integration,​ ​etc.

14. **The**​ ​**Business**​ ​**stakeholders**​​ ​who​ ​wrote​ ​the​ ​high​ ​level​ ​vision​ ​for​ ​the​ ​mobile​ ​application are​ ​going​ ​to​ ​help​ ​refine​ ​or​ ​define​ ​the​ ​user​ ​needs.​ ​They​ ​currently​ ​sit​ ​in​ ​different​ ​building. They​ ​are​ ​working​ ​on​ ​writing​ ​detailed​ ​requirements​ ​and​ ​planning​ ​to​ ​hand-off​ ​to​ ​you​ ​in​ ​2 weeks.

1. Your​ ​peers​ ​have​ ​suggested​ ​that​ ​you​ ​want​ ​to​ ​be​ ​sure​ ​that​ ​the​ ​project​ ​will​ ​please​ ​key stakeholders,​ ​in​ ​particular​ ​Harold,​ ​the​ ​project​ ​sponsor,​ ​and​ ​Tricia,​ ​the​ ​VP​ ​of​ ​Marketing. Both​ ​of​ ​these​ ​senior​ ​managers​ ​are​ ​very​ ​aware​ ​of​ ​customers’​ ​needs,​ ​so​ ​it​ ​is​ ​important that​ ​the​ ​new​ ​service​ ​is​ ​stable,​ ​secure,​ ​and​ ​easy​ ​to​ ​use.
2. They​ ​both​ ​want​ ​the​ ​remote​ ​deposit​ ​capture​ ​capability​ ​to​ ​be​ ​ready​ ​as​ ​soon​ ​as​ ​possible​ ​so the​ ​company​ ​can​ ​start​ ​promoting​ ​this​ ​new​ ​service.

17. **High**​ ​**Level**​ ​**Vision**​:​ ​Here​ ​are​ ​the​ ​High​ ​Level​ ​Vision​ ​for​ ​the​ ​Remote​ ​Deposit​ ​Capture: **18.** Using​ ​the​​ ​**new**​ ​**mobile**​ ​**app,**​ ​​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​customers​ ​can:

1. Download​ ​an​ ​app​ ​for​ ​iPhone,​ ​android​ ​phones,​ ​windows​ ​phones
2. Login​ ​in​ ​the​ ​app​ ​using​ ​their​ ​internet​ ​portal​ ​account​ ​or​ ​identify​ ​themselves​ ​using

other​ ​authentication​ ​methods.

1. View​ ​balance​ ​of​ ​their​ ​accounts
2. Deposit​ ​checks​ ​to​ ​deposit​ ​account
   1. take​ ​secure/fraud​ ​proof​ ​pictures​ ​of​ ​checks​ ​\(back​ ​and​ ​front\)
   2. enter​ ​details​ ​of​ ​the​ ​check​ ​-​ ​like​ ​amt
   3. Select​ ​account​ ​to​ ​deposit
   4. validate​ ​check​ ​image​ ​against​ ​the​ ​entered​ ​details
   5. deposit​ ​the​ ​e-check​ ​into​ ​the​ ​bank​ ​account
3. Provide​ ​opportunity​ ​for​ ​bank​ ​to​ ​share​ ​new​ ​offers​ ​and​ ​promotions​ ​to​ ​customers.

**19. New**​ ​**browser**​ ​**plugin**​ ​​should​ ​support:

1. Secure/fraud​ ​proof​ ​scanning​ ​of​ ​checks
2. Support​ ​IE,​ ​Firefox,​ ​Chrome​ ​and​ ​Safari
3. Add​ ​support​ ​for​ ​pre-approved​ ​supported​ ​scanners.
4. Work​ ​with​ ​other​ ​scanners​ ​that​ ​supports​ ​ISO​ ​protocols​ ​for​ ​scanners.

e. Work​ ​seamlessly​ ​with​ ​pre-approved​ ​supported​ ​scanner  
20. **Changes**​ ​**to**​ ​**bank’s**​ ​**internet**​ ​**portal**​​ ​will​ ​allow​ ​Blue​ ​Bank​ ​customers​ ​to:

1. Create​ ​/​ ​update​ ​/​ ​delete​ ​deposit​ ​account

**Assignment**

The case study specifies some of the key functionality that the IT team needs to build. You are responsible for the mobile app.

For the mobile app, create a story map to show the user experience and what you need to build. Feel free to add fictitious functionality and features as you feel appropriate. You will be graded on the quality, completeness, and correctness of your story map.

Please make sure that your story map has all the functionality listed in mobile app section \(section 18\) in the case study. 

You may create the story map using any tool you wish \(for example, LibreOffice Writer/Draw or Microsoft Word/Visio\). Once finished, you will upload the document here.

Blue Bank has always used the traditional waterfall method to deliver IT projects. Harold Johnson and the company leadership have suggested that you also use traditional methods to build the software. You have a different idea. You think agile would be better for this situation. 

In the space below, make a case to Harold as to why we should switch to agile \(explain why using agile is a better choice for this project/situation\). Be sure to support your argument by referring back to the case study text.

Why to use it, with the various aspects and functions that Blue Bank want to have available to customers to allow deposits it will take a vast amount of estimating and release planning which Agile is designed for but especially with the need to finish on time of 6 months and on budget with the quality service that is demanded

The team does not have a great deal of experience in mobile applications, testing or understanding the agile mindset being adaptive but the application of the mindset of define, design, build and test is going to be key in getting the project done.

Assume Harold liked your argument and agreed to proceed with agile on this project. In his reply, Harold asked for further guidance on how to move forward. Please reply back with the following:

1. What things will have to change on how this team operates and how key stakeholders interact or engage on this project. \(Hint: as you have learned, for agile to be successful there are certain prerequisites and it poses certain challenges for leadership/business stakeholders as well\)
2. The team is new to Agile and based on prerequisites for agile to be successful, please specify if you and your team need any help or training etc. If none, please state that.

How the team operates is going to work around adopting the mindset, Define, design, build, test but breaking down the task into small bite size chunks rather than big functions as a set task.

Getting the team out their offices, to the same floor, same area so that they are on the same page early, having those face to face conversations as developers. In addition having the other stakeholders working and having the conversations to encourage the team organization is key, so bringing in Harold and Tricia the VP so they are involved

Then working with the team to break down some of the barriers that are going to naturally exist with the new methodology having never used it, they are not aware of the agile and it’s methods so bring the team up to speed with the components early and getting them onboard early.

Harold is pretty impressed by your response and has approved all of your recommendations in previous two responses. He then re-iterated the key criteria for success and asked you if he and his management team should expect anything different from this project in terms for tracking and status updates.

Are there any project constraints laid out in the case study that need to be changed/managed since you will be using agile and, in agile, planning, estimation and tracking happens differently? 

_Hint_: The case study implies certain project constraints/expectations around cost, timeline, other factors that need to managed/changed.

There are major constraints of factors that need to be taken into consideration with the planning and sprints for the development plan.

Time line of 6 months means that there must be a strong adoption of the scrum methodology in order to get this over the line. As the team do not have the experience early sprints may be slow to get going however the use of Burndown / Burnup charts – breaking down what daily work is needed and to be finalised for each sprint.

Cost and operating costs of the platform being of up most importance to the stakeholders and the need to deliver on budget will mean that the testing phase capture as few bugs as possible so using pair programming may help them with it.

Finally breaking down the requirements and design of what is required by having the conversations to fully understand what the bank want. This can be done using the agile planning to have the strategy and vision in mind when creating the backlog the dev team are going to work with.
